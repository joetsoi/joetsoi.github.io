      <title>Pixel Games in Rust With ggez - Fixing Blurry Images</title>

      <description>TL; DR - if you are making a pixel art game with rust + ggez and scaling the textures, then you probably want to set the default filtering to Nearest, with the line
graphics::set_default_filter(ctx,graphics::FilterMode::Nearest);The problem This basic ggez example that draws an image to the screen.
useggez;useggez::event;useggez::graphics;useggez::nalgebra;useggez::{Context,GameResult};struct MainState{image: graphics::Image,}implMainState{fn new(ctx: &amp;amp;mutContext)-&amp;gt; GameResult&amp;lt;MainState&amp;gt;{lets=MainState{image: graphics::Image::new(ctx,&amp;#34;/map.png&amp;#34;)?,};Ok(s)}}implevent::EventHandlerforMainState{fn update(&amp;amp;mutself,_ctx: &amp;amp;mutContext)-&amp;gt; GameResult{Ok(())}fn draw(&amp;amp;mutself,ctx: &amp;amp;mutContext)-&amp;gt; GameResult{graphics::draw(ctx,&amp;amp;self.image,graphics::DrawParam::new().scale(nalgebra::Vector2::new(3.0,3.0)),)?;graphics::present(ctx)?;Ok(())}}pubfn main()-&amp;gt; GameResult{letcb=ggez::ContextBuilder::new(&amp;#34;pixel art example&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;ggez&amp;#34;);let(ctx,event_loop)=&amp;amp;mutcb.build()?;letstate=&amp;amp;mutMainState::new(ctx)?;event::run(ctx,event_loop,state)}The result is not what you might expect if you&#39;re looking for crisp pixel art.</description>

      <title>Django Admin Single Line Unlimited Input For Postgres</title>
      <link>https://the.chuntering.dev/posts/django-admin-single-line-unlimited-input/</link>

      <guid>https://the.chuntering.dev/posts/django-admin-single-line-unlimited-input/</guid>
      <description>If you need a single line input for a CharField in django admin but want unlimited length input? Are you using postgres? Then you can use this snippet.
 varchar(n) is Bad See https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_varchar.28n.29_by_default
Why not TextArea? Why not use TextArea? This defaults to a multiline input, and you&#39;d need to override it for every single CharField you use.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3469979/django-admin-overriding-the-widget-of-a-custom-form-field/4466958#4466958
How does it work? We override the database used in the CharField and just use varchar, This is the same perfomance wise as varchar(n) and text.</description>

      <title>OpenMoonstone V0.2 Released</title>
      <link>https://the.chuntering.dev/posts/openmoonstone-v0-2-released/</link>

      <guid>https://the.chuntering.dev/posts/openmoonstone-v0-2-released/</guid>
      <description>OpenMoonstone v0.2 released OpenMoonstone is a open source reimplementation of Moonstone: A Hard Day&#39;s Knight following along the lines of projects like OpenTTD and OpenXcom. You can try it out https://github.com/joetsoi/OpenMoonstone
This release is a milestone as it contains the same number of features as the original demo that came out on the Amiga.
Why reimplement an old game? Fixing bugs   Original     OpenMoonstone v0.2   Enemies always face the player in Moonstone, in the original this meant that for the AI controlled knights, the distance the knight would move was out of sync with the animation causing a &amp;ldquo;jumpy&amp;rdquo; animation.</description>

      <description>Runtime Copy Paste With Global Variable Replacement. &amp;ldquo;Could you make InlineAdmin in Django paginatable Joe?&amp;rdquo; Guido asked. I googled a while before regurgitating a Stackoverflow answer into Guido&#39;s lap. &amp;ldquo;Oh cool, but we have multiple InlineAdmins, can you make it paginate for all of them?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sure&amp;rdquo; I replied, &amp;ldquo;That&#39;ll just be a change to the admin class and some templates&amp;rdquo;
&amp;hellip; Time passes
I had quickly changed the p variable so it was dynamically determined by the model name assigned to the InlineAdmin class by adding a page_param property.</description>

      <description>After many hours I&#39;ve succeeded in reverse engineering a small part of the old DOS game Moonstone!I plan on posting all the gory details, but it&#39;s a bit late at the moment but just running the image viewer script I hacked together and seeing the working result is so pleasing.</description>

      <description>Are you a CKAN developer? Have you had a trip or fall at work involving a slow running sql query that wasn&#39;t your fault? Do you terribly miss the django debug toolbar, pyramid debugtoolbar, flask debugtoolbar or similar? Well you&#39;re basically screwed, but to help alleviate the pain I made a tiny ckan extension that integrates the SQLTap middleware with ckan, once you&#39;ve added &amp;lsquo;sqltap&amp;rsquo; to your list of plugins in your development init you&#39;ll find the sqltap interface at</description>

      <title>Translating Ckan Extensions Using The ITranslations Interface</title>

      <description>From ckan 2.5 onwards you will be able to translate the strings in ckan extensions in a much more friendly and easy way. Unless there are any major issues in the code review, this pull request should make your life easier.
Previously, there were a few, not ideal solutions (see ckan#959) which involved having a paster command or script that would munge all the po/mo files together using gettext&#39;s msgcat command.</description>

      <description>Back when I was young child, my brothers and I used to play a game called Moonstone. So it was with a bit of nostalgic glee that I went about spending a few hours or so in evening poking around the innards of the game. I wish I had bothered to take a look at the time, as I managed to remove the unbelievably long, unskippable intro that the game has, which would of saved my brothers and I a few hours of pain, enduring the intro whilst waiting for the game to start.</description>

      <title>Randomising Traitor Numbers in Trouble in Terrorist Town</title>

      <description>A while back a group of friends and I went through a spate of playing TTT(Trouble in Terrorist Town), to the point where we ended up playing during that Christmas day post dinner lull.
For me, TTT scratches the traitor game mechanic that you can find in board games like The Resistance, Battlestar Galactica and Shadows Over Camelot which you don&#39;t really get in any other computer game. Unlike these games, the number of traitors is rigidly defined by the total number of players by a formula.</description>

      <title>Digging into python memory issues in ckan with heapy</title>

      <description>So we had a report about a memory leak when using the ckan datastore extension, where large queries to the datastore would leak large amounts of memory per request. It wasn&#39;t simple to get to the bottom of it, at first I couldn&#39;t recreate it the leak at all. The test data I was using was the STAR experiment csv files, which I found when I googled &amp;lsquo;Large example csv files&amp;rsquo;.</description>
