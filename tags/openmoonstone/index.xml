      <description>OpenMoonstone v0.2 released OpenMoonstone is a open source reimplementation of Moonstone: A Hard Day&#39;s Knight following along the lines of projects like OpenTTD and OpenXcom. You can try it out https://github.com/joetsoi/OpenMoonstone
This release is a milestone as it contains the same number of features as the original demo that came out on the Amiga.
Why reimplement an old game? Fixing bugs   Original     OpenMoonstone v0.2   Enemies always face the player in Moonstone, in the original this meant that for the AI controlled knights, the distance the knight would move was out of sync with the animation causing a &amp;ldquo;jumpy&amp;rdquo; animation.</description>
