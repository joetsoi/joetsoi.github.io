      <description>After many hours I&#39;ve succeeded in reverse engineering a small part of the old DOS game Moonstone!I plan on posting all the gory details, but it&#39;s a bit late at the moment but just running the image viewer script I hacked together and seeing the working result is so pleasing.</description>

      <description>Back when I was young child, my brothers and I used to play a game called Moonstone. So it was with a bit of nostalgic glee that I went about spending a few hours or so in evening poking around the innards of the game.
