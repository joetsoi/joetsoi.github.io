      <description>Are you a CKAN developer? Have you had a trip or fall at work involving a slow running sql query that wasn&amp;rsquo;t your fault? Do you terribly miss the django debug toolbar, pyramid debugtoolbar, flask debugtoolbar or similar? Well you&amp;rsquo;re basically screwed, but to help alleviate the pain I made a tiny ckan extension that integrates the SQLTap middleware with ckan, once you&amp;rsquo;ve added &amp;lsquo;sqltap&amp;rsquo; to your list of plugins in your development init you&amp;rsquo;ll find the sqltap interface at</description>

      <description>From ckan 2.5 onwards you will be able to translate the strings in ckan extensions in a much more friendly and easy way. Unless there are any major issues in the code review, this pull request should make your life easier.
Previously, there were a few, not ideal solutions (see ckan#959) which involved having a paster command or script that would munge all the po/mo files together using gettext&amp;rsquo;s msgcat command.</description>

      <title>Digging into python memory issues in ckan with heapy</title>

      <description>So we had a report about a memory leak when using the ckan datastore extension, where large queries to the datastore would leak large amounts of memory per request. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t simple to get to the bottom of it, at first I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recreate it the leak at all. The test data I was using was the STAR experiment csv files, which I found when I googled &amp;lsquo;Large example csv files&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>WTF is this context thing in CKAN?</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look at the ckan source code, you&amp;rsquo;ll have come across &amp;lsquo;context&amp;rsquo; as the first parameter in many of the functions. It basically contains all threadlocal information required for a function to execute. It&amp;rsquo;s taken me far too long to understand why they exist and I currently think contexts in their current state are pointless.
I&amp;rsquo;m assuming contexts only contain model, session and user. I get why context exists, it basically comes down to whether</description>

      <title>CKAN Developer Discovers C Headers</title>

      <description>At some point at university I borrowed, read a tiny amount of and got fined for the late return of Large Scale C++ software design. I think somewhere at the beginning there was a section on using headers to avoid circular imports. ckan is a large enough project that we can learn a thing or two here.
So we have a ckan python style guide, where we used to recommend avoiding</description>

      <title>CKAN Sqlalchemy and Detached Instance Errors</title>
      <link>https://the.chuntering.dev/posts/ckan-sqlalchemy-and-detached-instance-errors/</link>

      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use SQLAlchemy sessions We use sqlalchemy in ckan and often we run into problems with DetachedInstanceErrors. For this reason, we normally jam all the data from a model object into a dictionary to avoid getting the DetachedInstanceError. This isn&amp;rsquo;t sqlachemy&amp;rsquo;s fault, it&amp;rsquo;s more than likely that we are just incapable of using it properly.
For a while, we kept on running into issues where paster db clean would hang and I spent a while trying to figure out what the hell was going on and what was wrong with the session.</description>
