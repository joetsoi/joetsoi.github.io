      <description>A while back a group of friends and I went through a spate of playing TTT(Trouble in Terrorist Town), to the point where we ended up playing during that Christmas day post dinner lull.
For me, TTT scratches the traitor game mechanic that you can find in board games like The Resistance, Battlestar Galactica and Shadows Over Camelot which you don&amp;rsquo;t really get in any other computer game. Unlike these games, the number of traitors is rigidly defined by the total number of players by a formula.</description>
