    <h1>CKAN SQLAlchemy and <code>DetachedInstanceError</code>s</h1>
    <h2>We don't know how to use SQLAlchemy sessions</h2>
    <p>We use sqlalchemy in ckan and often we run into problems with <code>DetachedInstanceErrors</code>. For this reason, we normally jam all the data from a model object into a dictionary to avoid getting the <code>DetachedInstanceError</code>. This isn't sqlachemy's fault, it's more than likely that we are just incapable of using it properly.</p>

    <p>For a while, we kept on running into issues where <code>paster db clean</code> would hang and I spent a while trying to figure out what the hell was going on and what was wrong with the session.</p>

    <p>As it turned out, there was nothing wrong session really, it was just that we were handling it badly for command line functions. There were basically 2 problems.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Not closing transactions that are implicity opened by sqlalchemy</li>
        <li>Closing and removing a session and then attempting to use the sqlalchemy objects from that session causing <code>DetachedInstanceErrors</code></li>
    </ol>

    <p>To demonstrate this, we're going to use do some fiddling with ckan from the ipython command line shell. We'll start by basically running through ckan's database initialisation code, but we'll pass in <code>echo=True</code>, so that all the SQL statements that are execute are echoed onto the command line.</p>

<p>Notice the implicit <code>BEGIN</code>, even though we only executed a select. SQLAlchemy will always wrap our sessions in transactions for us when using the ORM. It is this transaction that we generally do not close when we fetch config options from the database, or fetch the site user. Normally this would be ok, but for example when running <code>paster db clean</code>, the metadata gets binded again and the call to <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/ckan/model/__init__.py#L233">reflect</a> causes a new connection to be created as we are already in a transaction. Since the previous transaction has a lock on the database this causes our problem 1, and <code>paster db clean</code> hangs. If you're really interested you can look at the issues on github here(<a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/1656">#1656</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/1123">#1123</a>).</p>
<p>We'll run into our second problem next.</p>

<p>Our Session registry currently has an active session. Of which our dataset object is a part of, next we run <code>get_site_user</code>.</p>

<p>If we now try to use any ORM related features of our object, such as following a relation, we'll get a DetachedInstanceError. In the case of ckanext spatial this is caused by the <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial/blob/fa4161af8714106e10b724afe775674473993e9c/ckanext/spatial/harvesters/base.py#L411">previous_object</a> becoming detached as <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial/blob/fa4161af8714106e10b724afe775674473993e9c/ckanext/spatial/harvesters/base.py#L418">get_site_user</a> is called after it. When the <code>previous_object</code> is used later, probably here as it tries to get the HarvestJob object it'll fail, accessing other stuff like previous_object.current will work fine as it doesn't have to goto the database to fetch a related object.</p>

<p>So we ended up having to fix the first problem by closing the transactions by <code>get_site_user</code> and <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/ckan/model/system_info.py#L31">get_system_info</a>, and we could do something like a <code>model.Session.remove()</code> before the <code>drop_all</code> in <code>clean_db</code>, (we do a similar thing in <code>delete_all()</code>)</p>

<p>The second problem was fixed by changing <code>get_site_user</code> to only commit and not remove the session.</p>

<p>These two problems were fixed in 2.1.3 and 2.2.1 onwards so hopefully you'll never have to run into them.</p>

<p>This post is basically <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/1714#issuecomment-43745098">ckan/ckan#1714</a></p>
